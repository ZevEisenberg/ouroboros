# ouroboros
This is a Swift/Objective-C ouroboros.

An ouroboros is a type of [quine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_(computing)) where the programs will print each other in a loop - in this case, the Swift code prints the Objective-C program, and the Objective-C program in turn prints the Swift program. They can loop forever, producing exactly the same source code for each other.

I wrote this as a celebration of Swift 3 being officially released, since these are two languages that are near and dear to my heart. I hope you enjoy it!
